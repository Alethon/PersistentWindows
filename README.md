# PersistentWindows
The code is forked from http://www.ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows/ with enhancements on more robust remote desktop support and much lower cpu usage.

It seems to be a perfect solution to this unsolved Windows problem since Windows 7 era

# Original description
```
What is PersistentWindows?
A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts 
and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run 
this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

```
# Key features 
- Keeps track of windows layout, automatically restores last windows layout with matching monitor setup
- Manages different monitor setups automatically (dual monitor setup, single monitor setup etc)
- Remote desktop session also benefits from running this software on target machine, whether monitor setup matches or not.
- Can be run as Windows startup job

# Installation
