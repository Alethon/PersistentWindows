# PersistentWindows
This is forked from http://www.ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows/ with enhanced remote desktop support and lower cpu usage.

# Original description
```
What is PersistentWindows?
A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts 
and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run 
this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

```
# Key features 
- Manages multiple windows layout settings, and automatically resumes previous windows layout with matching monitor setup. 
- Can be run as windows startup job
