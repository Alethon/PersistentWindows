# PersistentWindows
The code is forked from http://www.ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows/ with enhancements on more robust remote desktop support and much lower cpu usage.

It seems to be a perfect solution to this unsolved Windows problem since Windows 7 era

# Original description
```
What is PersistentWindows?
A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts 
and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run 
this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

```
# Key features 
- Keeps track of windows layout, automatically restores last windows layout with matching monitor setup
- Manages different monitor setups automatically (dual monitor setup, single monitor setup etc)
- Remote desktop session also benefits from running this software on target machine, whether monitor setup matches or not.
- Can be run as Windows startup job

# Installation
- Download latest PersistentWindows*.zip file from https://github.com/kangyu-california/PersistentWindows/releases
- Unzip the file into any directory, do NOT choose C:\Program Files\ unless you want to run the program with admin privilege.
- Optionally create a shortcut to PersistentWindows.exe in C:\Users\\<your_user_id>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup to automatically start the program when computer powers up.

# Use instructions
- Run PersistentWindows.exe, a splash window will pop up, indicating the program has started successfully.
- PersistentWindows will automatically save window positions and restore them when monitor setup is changed or when user login to previous session.
- There will be an icon in the systray area on task bar.
- To capture taskbar position change, right click the icon and select "Capture" 
- If automated window recovery fails, right click the icon and select "Restore" to do window recovery again, do NOT move mouse in the next few seconds to help taskbar recovery.
