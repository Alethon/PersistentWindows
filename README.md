What is PersistentWindows?
A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts 
and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run 
this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

```
# My description 
- Automatically resumes previous windows layout with matching monitor setup
- Manages multiple layout settings on the target windows machine. For example the target machine is hooked to dual monitors in the office, and you want a different windows layout when remote work from home using only one monitor or from a laptop with smaller screen.
