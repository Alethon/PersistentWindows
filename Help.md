* Run PW with customized icon (since version 5.11)
  * Rename your customized icon file as pwIcon.ico and copy it to 'C:/Users/\<YOUR_ID>/AppData/Local/PersistentWindows/', or copy it to current directory if running (second inst of) PW with -redirect_appdata switch from command console.
  * Add second icon file, rename it to pwIconBusy.ico, this icon is displayed when PW is busy restoring windows.

* Manipulate window z-order
  * Bring a window to top z-order, force clear the topmost flag of obstructing window
    * Click on other window first to defocus, then hold CTRL key pressed and click on the window (or the corresponding icon on taskbar) that you want to bring to top.
  * Send a window to bottom z-order (similar to Alt-Esc which however does not work for remote desktop window)
    * Defocus the window first, then hold CTRL-WIN keys pressed and click on the window
